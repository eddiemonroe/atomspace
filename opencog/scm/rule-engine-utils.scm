;;; Commentary:
;
; Handy utilities for working with the rule-engine. In particular to
; configure a rule-based system (rbs).
;
; Utilities include:
; -- ure-add-rule -- Associate a rule to a rbs
; -- ure-add-rules -- Associate  a list of rule-alias and weight pairs to a rbs
; -- ure-set-num-parameter -- Set a numeric parameter of an rbs
; -- ure-set-fuzzy-bool-parameter -- Set a fuzzy boolean parameter of an rbs
; -- ure-define-rbs -- Create a rbs that runs for a parituclar number of
;                      iterations.
;
; If you add more utilities don't forget to add them in the
; export-rule-engine-utils function.
