 * Given a term, substitute one set of atoms for another within that
 * term.  That is, given a substituion map from atoms to atoms, then,
 * if the term contains a substitutable atom in it, then the
 * substutition will be made. The entire term will be searched, i.e.
 * recursively downwards. However, only one level of substitution is
 * performed; that is, atoms in the substituted terms won't be
 * substituted.
 *
 * Similar to the Instantiator class, but does not execute stuff;
 * also can substitute non-VariableNode atoms.
 *
 * Similar to VariableList's substitute() method, but works for
 * non-VariableNode atoms.
