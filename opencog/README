                  -------------------

This directory contains core AtomSpace code.  Tests, example and demo
programs have their own directories.

Source code overview:

atomspace       -- Defines atoms, nodes, links, truth values, etc.
                   Everything else depends on this.

atoms           -- Assorted C++ definitions of specific atom types.
                   These are the "imperative" atoms, atoms that
                   "do things" when they are executed.

persist         -- Methods for communication between servers, also,
                   saving/restoring the atomspace to databases.

query           -- Pattern matching, evaluation for the atomspace.

guile, scm      -- Scheme language bindings.
haskell         -- Haskell language bindings.
python,cython   -- Python langauge bindings.

benchmark       -- Performance benchmarks.

rule-engine     -- Forward and backward-chainers.
