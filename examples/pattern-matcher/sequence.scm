; Demonstrate using the GroundedPredicateNode to provide a simple
; behavior sequence: i.e. a set of steps that are conditionally played
; out, depending on whether the predicate node returns true of false.
; There are no variables in this demo; thus, the sequence is not
; a graph search, but is rather a straight-forward if-else sequence
; evaluation.
;
; This demo also demonstrates the use of a SatisfactionLink: there is no
; output, and no graph-rewriting occurs, thus a BindLink is not needed,
; and the simpler SatisfactionLink is enough.
;
; The SatisfactionLink, combined with the SequentialAndLink, implement
; the concept of a behavior tree "sequence node". See
; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior_Trees_(artificial_intelligence,_robotics_and_control)

; The run this, you probably need to do this:

; OCDIR=home/home/yourname/opencog
; export LTDL_LIBRARY_PATH=$OCDIR/build/opencog/guile:$OCDIR/build/opencog/query
;
; Add the following to your ~/.guile file:
; (add-to-load-path "/home/yourname/opencog/build")
; (add-to-load-path "/home/yourname/opencog/opencog/scm")
; (add-to-load-path ".")
;
; Start guile:
; guile
;
; and then load this file:
; (load-from-path "sequence.scm")
;
; Then, scroll to the bottom, and some of the commented-out
; examples.
